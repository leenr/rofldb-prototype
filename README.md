## ROFL DB (Proof of Concept / Prototype)

The name and everything else (design, algorithms) is subject to change.

I will add technical details later, but in the meantime you can get the idea by looking to the code (see [src/library.cpp](src/library.cpp) and [build.py](build.py)).
I also have plans to make a Rust library later - that will allow me also to make a bindings to other languages.
