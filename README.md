## ROFL DB (PoC)

Thank you for reviewing the PoC code! :)
The name and everything else (design, code) is subject to change!

I will add technical details later, but in the meantime it's simple enough to get the idea simply by looking to the code (see [src/library.cpp](src/library.cpp) and [build.py](build.py)).

If you have any questions - please contact me, I will happily explain everything :)

### License
It's BSD for now, but for the public release I'm currently considering to make it Public Domain if everything remains that simple like it is now :)

It does not even link to any libraries besides to glibc.

If you will input something big, and don't want for it to become Public Domain, please reach out to me (although I really want to do the library Public Domain, and also I will not even consider release it with license less permissive than BSD/MIT).
